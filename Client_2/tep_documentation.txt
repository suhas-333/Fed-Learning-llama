--- Known Fault Information ---
- Fault 8: Involves a random variation in the A, B, C feed composition. This would primarily affect variables related to feed streams and reactor conditions.
- Fault 9: Involves a random variation in the D feed temperature.
- Fault 15: Involves a condenser cooling water valve sticking. This would affect condenser and reactor cooling variables.
